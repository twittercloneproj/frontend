# The project (Golang microservices + Angular) represents a social network for posting and viewing short posts, similar to Twitter. The application is developed according to the principles of microservices architecture, and data is stored in various types of NoSQL databases. Types of users: </br> - unauthenticated user: can register on the system, obtaining a regular account. If they have an account, they can log in to the system. </br> - regular authenticated user: a user who has logged in with a regular profile. They can post, retweet, and like posts, follow other users, view their profiles, adjust profile privacy settings and receive recommendations for new follows.
# Parts of the system:
# Client application: provides a graphical interface through which users access the system's functionalities.
# Server application: a microservices-based application that contains the entire business logic of the system. It consists of the following services: </br> - auth: stores user credentials and their roles in the system. responsible for the registration and login process of users. Stores data in a document database (MongoDB). </br> profile: contains information about users' basic data, such as name, surname, gender, age, email, etc. Supports profile privacy settings. Stores data in a document database (MongoDB). </br> tweet: stores all posted tweets, retweets, and their likes. Provides the display of the home and profile feeds. Stores data in a wide-column database (CassandraDB). </br> - social graph: stores information about mutual followings among profiles and provides profile recommendations. Stores data in a graph database (Neo4jDB).
# Functional requirements: </br> - profile registration (unauthenticated user) - a regular profile is registered by entering the following information: first name, last name, gender, age, place of residence, username (must be unique), and password. </br> - system login (unauthenticated user) - by entering a username and password, the user can access their account and functionalities corresponding to their user type (regular user). </br> - posting a tweet (regular user) A tweet can contain text content. </br> - liking a tweet (regular user) - each tweet can be liked by a profile at most once. If a user has already liked a post and tries to do so again, the action will have no effect. It is possible to view a list of users who liked each tweet. </br> viewing profiles (regular user) - the profile page contains basic information about the profile and a list of tweets that the user has posted. </br> - profile privacy settings (regular user) - after creation, profiles are initially private. The content of private profiles is not accessible to profiles that do not follow them, while the content of public profiles is visible to everyone. Users can e to choose whether their profile is public or private. </br> following profiles (regular user) - if a profile is public, it can be automatically followed. If it is private, a follow request is created, which can be confirmed or rejected. When a profile is followed, all of its posts are visible regardless of whether it is public or private. The user's profile displays a list of all users the profile follows and a list of profiles that follow the user. </br> - home feed (regular user) </br> the home feed contains a list of tweets from the user and all other users followed by that profile. Tweets are sorted in descending order by date and time of posting. </br> - retweet (regular user) - users can retweet any tweet they can access. When they do so, the retweet is treated like any other tweet from that user, with an indication that it is a retweet. The original user who posted it must be indicated. If the profile that originally posted the tweet is private and the user viewing the retweet does not follow that profile, the content of the retweet should be hidden, but not the name of the person who posted it. </br> - profile recommendations (regular user) - based on the profiles the user follows, suggest other profiles that the user is not currently following but might find interesting (e.g., profiles followed by the profiles the user follows). Also, cases are considered where the user is not following anyone.
# Non-functional requirements: </br> - API Gateway - represents the entry point to the system, and all communication between the server and client applications is done through it. The API gateway provides REST APIs to clients for communication. </br> - containerization - all microservices, the API Gateway, and databases are running as Docker containers and utilize the Docker Compose tool. </br> - Circuit Breaker - the circuit breaker pattern is implemented in one of the microservices.
# Security of the system and data protection - The following security mechanisms are implemented: </br> - data validation (relevant injection attacks are prevented, XSS attacks are prevented, data validation using validation criteria defined according to best practices for writing secure code are performed). </br> HTTPS communication (secure communication between the API gateway and the client application) </br> - authentication and access control (mechanisms for account verification, password recovery and password change are enabled, control access to endpoints based on the RBAC model, access control for the frontend part). </br> data Protection (sensitive data used by the application are secured while stored, during transport and during use). </br> - a logging mechanism is implemented that ensures completeness, reliability and conciseness. </br> - vulnerabilities (tools are defines to be used for checking various sets of components, each of the components is tested and a list of vulnerabilities is compiled, the severity of vulnerabilities and their exploitability are analyzed, a strategy for resolving potential risks are defined and executed, report is created of some kind, highlighting the thoroughness of the analysis and the final results)
